The aim of the project is to unite the cities in a country based on the conditions.
At first all the countries are enemy to each other. Therefore, the enemy count is set to total city count in country - 1.
In one turn, each country can send one envoy each other. Therefore the envoy count is set to 1.

The algorithm starts by checking the ally status of the cities in the country
If there is no enemy in each country, the program will be terminated and write the turn count to the file.
If there is an enemy in a country;
    Try to unite available cities
        Pick a city in country
        Get its adjacent cities
        Find an enemy adjacent among them
        Make an alliance with that adjacent
        Decrease the count of the envoy from a city which has a envoy (It has a chance to be used before).
        Update the adjacency list of these two countries. (Now they can make an alignment to each other's adjacent cities)
        Decrease the count of enemy count of these two cities
        Add these cities as ally to each other
    Increase the turn count
    Reset the envoy count for each city in land for next turn

There are two arguments for program
First argument: input file path
Second argument: output file path
